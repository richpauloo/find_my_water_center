## About

Enter you address in the left sidebar to locate your nearest water systems. Distances are calculated between the location you enter and water system centroids, so it is possible that the point you enter falls within a water system.

***  

## Data and Code

The full list of ~ 4,000 water systems is publicly available from the [California Environmental Health Tracking Program](http://www.phi.org/focus-areas/?program=california-environmental-health-tracking-network-program), and can be downloaded [here](http://cehtp.org/water/).

Code for this project can be found in [this Github repository](https://github.com/richpauloo/find_my_water_center).
