This repo contains files used to build a simple R Shiny app that geocodes addresses in California and returns the closest water systems to the input location in an interactive map. The app lives [here](https://richpauloo.shinyapps.io/find_water_system/).  

`/app`  - contains the ui, server, and global files  
`/code` - preprocessing scripts to munge and prepare data  
`/data` - the raw data
